# Girls Who Code Games
A collection of small games I created as an instructor for the **Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program**, along with a folder of student-created projects.

### These games are designed to teach:
- Game mechanics: movement, collision, scoring
- HTML/CSS structure for interactive content
- JavaScript programming and logic for dynamic gameplay

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Some games have audioâ€”make sure your volume is set to a comfortable level.
