# Girls Who Code Games
A collection of small games I created as an instructor for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.

### These games are designed to teach:
- Game mechanics: movement, collision, scoring
- HTML/CSS structure for interactive content
- JavaScript programming and logic for dynamic gameplay
